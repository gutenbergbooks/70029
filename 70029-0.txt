BIOGRAPHY


Jesse Walter Fewkes, Chief of the Bureau of American Ethnology, is the
son of Jesse and Susan Emeline (Jewett) Fewkes. He was born in Newton,
Mass., November 14, 1850. His father and mother were born in Ipswich,
Mass. On his mother’s side his American ancestry goes back to the
close of the seventeenth century. He fitted for college in 1871 and
entered without conditions. He was graduated from Harvard with honor
in Natural History in the class of 1875 and was elected in the society
of Phi Beta Kappa. When a student in the Agassiz School, at Penikese
Island, Buzzards Bay, in 1873, he came under the inspiring influence
of the great naturalist, Louis Agassiz. After graduation he took a
post-graduate course in Natural History, receiving the degrees of A.
M. and Ph. D. in zoology in 1877. From 1878 to 1880 he studied zoology
at Leipzig under Rudolph Leuckart, and spent several months in Naples,
Italy, and Villa Franca, on the south coast of France, under the Harris
Fellowship.

In 1880 he was appointed assistant in the Museum of Comparative Zoology
at Harvard, and for nine years was in charge of lower invertebrata,
and from 1884 to 1887 was Assistant in Charge, every summer, of Mr.
Alexander Agassiz’s Newport, R. I., marine laboratory. In 1881 he
made a trip with Mr. Agassiz to study marine life at Key West and Dry
Tortugas, and in 1883 visited the Bermuda Islands for a similar purpose.

In the spring of 1887, as a guest of Mr. Augustus Hemenway, of Boston,
he pursued scientific studies at Santa Barbara, Santa Cruz, and
Monterey, Calif., and in the summer of 1888 he studied in Paris and
engaged in field work in marine zoology in Prof. Lacaze Duthier’s
zoological station at Roscoff, Brittany.

The visit to California marked a turning point in his life, as through
the influence of Mrs. Mary Hemenway, of Boston, he became profoundly
interested, in ethnological problems, especially of the Pueblos. In
the summer of 1889 and 1890 he visited Zuñi, New Mexico, and in the
latter year employed the phonograph in recording primitive music, a
method now universally adopted by ethnologists, and in 1891 used the
same instrument in recording Hopi songs. The records collected on these
trips were transcribed by Mr. B. I. Gilman under the titles “Zuñi
Melodies” and “Hopi Songs” and published in the Journal of American
Ethnology and Archæology, Vols. II and V, a scientific publication of
which Dr. Fewkes was founder and editor.

During these pioneer experiments with the phonograph among the Zuñi
and Hopi he became deeply interested in primitive religion, and for
four years was engaged in studies of the ritual of the latter, in the
employ of the late Mrs. Mary Hemenway. In order better to appreciate
Indian mythology and ritual, he was initiated into the Antelope and
Flute priesthoods of the Hopi, from which relationship many secret
ceremonies of this tribe were witnessed and described for the first
time. The archæology of the Zuñi and Hopi also interested him, and
while connected with the Hemenway Southwestern Expedition Dr. Fewkes
gathered in Arizona a large collection of Indian objects which is now
on exhibition in the Peabody Museum at Cambridge.

In 1892-93 Spain held an Historical Exposition at Madrid in
commemoration of the fourth centenary of the discovery of America
by Columbus. The Hemenway Expedition was requested by the Spanish
Government to participate in this celebration, and Dr. Fewkes had
charge of the Hemenway exhibit and served on the jury of awards.

Up to the year 1894 our knowledge of the Walpi Snake Dance was
fragmentary; since that date a large literature on it has accumulated.
The account of this startling festival published that year by Dr.
Fewkes is recognized as the most exhaustive on the subject that has
yet appeared. After the death of Mrs. Hemenway in 1894 the Hemenway
Southwestern Expedition was given up and in 1895 Dr. Fewkes was invited
to conduct archæological exploration in Arizona for the Smithsonian
Institution. He moved to Washington and for several years engaged
in field work for that Institution, during which time extensive
collections were made of prehistoric pottery and other objects, the
more striking specimens of which are now installed in the United States
National Museum. The publication of this material marks the beginning
of intensive archæological work on southwestern cliff-houses and
pueblos.

At the close of the Spanish war there was a demand for more scientific
literature on Porto Rico and the West Indies, which led to field work
in the islands and publication of the Report on the Aborigines of Porto
Rico and Neighboring Islands. In 1904 the Smithsonian Institution began
an archæological survey of the Gulf coast of Mexico, the results of
which appeared in “Antiquities of the Gulf Coast of Mexico.”

In the winters of 1906 and 1907 Dr. Fewkes had charge of the excavation
and repair of the ruin Casa Grande in southern Arizona, an illustrated
report on which was published in the Twenty-eighth Annual Report of
the Bureau of American Ethnology. In the summers of 1908 and 1909 he
excavated and repaired Spruce-tree House and Cliff Palace, and in 1915
and 1916, Sun Temple and Far View House, all situated on the Mesa
Verde National Park, in southwestern Colorado. In 1909 and 1910 he
visited large undescribed cliff-houses in the Navaho National Monument,
northern Arizona.

In the spring of 1910 he made a visit to the Isle of Pines, Cuba, and
the Grand Cayman, and in the winter of 1912 he made a trip to the
Lesser Antilles, excavating Indian mounds in Trinidad. The following
winter (1913) was spent in Europe, studying collections of West Indian
objects in the ethnological museums in Germany and Denmark. On that
visit he crossed the Mediterranean to Egypt and ascended the Nile to
the first cataract; on his return he revisited Greece and southern
Italy.

From a large collection of prehistoric pottery made in the Mimbres
Valley near Deming, New Mexico, in 1915, he was able to show the
existence in that valley of an extinct people with a characteristic
ceramic art. The summers of 1917 and 1918 were devoted to field work
among the prehistoric towers and castles of southwestern Colorado.

The zoological researches of Dr. Fewkes are mainly on the lower marine
invertebrata, Medusæ, Echinodermata, and Vermes; his ethnological
contributions deal with the Zuñi and Hopi Indians; his archæological
studies cover a more extensive area, including the Southwest, the
Antilles, and eastern Mexico.

Dr. Fewkes was honored in 1893 by Maria Cristina, Queen Regent of
Spain, with the decoration, “Isabel la Catolica,” grade of knight; and
in 1894 received from King Oscar of Sweden a gold medal, “Litteris
et Artibus,” for his discoveries in anthropology. He is a Fellow of
the American Academy of Arts and Sciences; a Corresponding Member of
the Essex Institute; Royal Anthropological Society, Florence, Italy;
Société des Americanists (1907-); Berlin Society of Anthropology;
Sociedad Antonio Alzarte, Mexico; Boston Society of Natural History,
of which he was secretary for several years; Naturalists’ Society;
President of the Anthropological Society of Washington (two terms
1909-10); President American Anthropological Association; associate
editor, American Anthropologist and Bulletin of the American
Geographical Society; and Vice-President (1911, 1912, 1915), Section
H, American Association for the Advancement of Science, and Folk-Lore
Society. He was editor of the Journal of American Ethnology and
Archæology, of which five volumes have been published, and has been for
several years one of the committee appointed by the Overseers to visit
the Peabody Museum at Harvard University, Cambridge; Member American
Antiquarian Society (1914-); Member National Academy of Sciences
(1914-); Ethnologist, Bureau of American Ethnology (1895-1917); Chief,
Bureau of American Ethnology (1918-). He was official representative of
the Smithsonian Institution at the inauguration of Dr. von Klein Smid
as President of the University of Arizona, in January, 1915, from which
he received the degree of LL.D. for services to anthropology.

Married at Cambridge, October 8, 1883, to Florence Gorges Eastman, who
died May 3, 1888, and again married at Roxbury, April 14, 1893, to
Harriet Olivia Cutler. His home is at Forest Glen, Maryland.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the
United States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG™
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for
copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very
easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away--you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected
by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg”), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg™ License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg™
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg™ electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. “Project Gutenberg” is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg™ electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg™
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (“the
Foundation” or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg™ License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg™ work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg™ License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg™ work (any work
on which the phrase “Project Gutenberg” appears, or with which the
phrase “Project Gutenberg” is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you will have to check the laws of the country where
  you are located before using this eBook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase “Project
Gutenberg” associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg™
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg™ License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg™
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg™.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg™ License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg™ work in a format
other than “Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg™ website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original “Plain
Vanilla ASCII” or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg™ License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg™ works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
provided that:

• You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, “Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation.”

• You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™
  works.

• You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

• You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg™ works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of
the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set
forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right
of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you “AS-IS”, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™

Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™'s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's business office is located at 809 North 1500 West,
Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up
to date contact information can be found at the Foundation's website
and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without
widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
